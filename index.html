        A common practice found in Medieval times was the game of Jousting. Not being part of the main event of a tournament,<break>
        a Joust was often the prelude to the main event. Two people mounted horses and rode them towards each other. They used <break>
        laces, which were often 10 feet in length, to knock the opponent off the horse.

       The Pike was a weapon found in the middle and late medieval period in Europe. Averaging in about 20 feet in length, the pike was handled with
       two hands and required high amounts of strength to wield. The length of the Pike was proven as advantageous because it allowed the holder to strike from a safer distance. At the tip, a strong metal laid sturdy for combat purposes. </p>

       The mace was a popular weapon that was often made out of wood or strong metal. The long shaft that the person would use was made up of wood
       and the ball at the end could differ. Instead of being spiked, it could be sphered and curved without any spikes. The mace was a symbol of 
     Medieval knights and were often used in tournaments because of its small weight. </p>
   <h1> Catapult </h1>

         The catapult during the medieval period was an important weapon. Originating from Greek roots, its name meant "Shield Piercing" 
        to symbolize the strength that catapult had. Catapults during the medieval period saw minimal uses because of the quick introduction 
        to gunpowder and new technology. Catapult originated from crossbows and was used to throw rocks or other payloads at walls or even armies. </p>
    <h1> War Hammer </h1>

        The war hammer was seen in the late medieval period and was as long as the mace. The War Hammer was versatile; it allowed for
         close combat to using it on horseback. The War Hammer was strong enough to pierce armor and damage people's helmets, leaving them concussed.
         The War Hammer could be used to strike the opponents horse and leave them vulnerable. Its early model resembles the modern hammer.
