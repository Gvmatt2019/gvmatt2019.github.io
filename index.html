      The Catalonia side started off the Champions league season strong, triumphing over Tottenham Hotspurs and Intern Milan.
      Currently they sit at the top of the LaLiga Table and haven't lost a LaLiga match for 4 months. Messi currently is the second top
      goalscorer in this year's Champion's League. Their strongest players include the French World Cup winner Ousmane Dembélé, 
      Argentina's best, Messi and Uruguay's Luis Suárez. Their midfield is one of the best in the world, but their aging players is going
      through a change, with Arthur and predestined Frenkie de Jong. They seem the most likely to win this year.
