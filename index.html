        A common practice found in Medieval times was the game of Jousting. Not being part of the main event of a tourament,
        a Joust was often the prelude to the main event. Two people mounted horses and rode them towards each other. They used 
        laces, which were often 10 feet in length, to knock the opponent off the horse.
