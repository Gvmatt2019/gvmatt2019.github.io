        A common practice found in Medieval times was the game of Jousting. Not being part of the main event of a tournament,<break>
        a Joust was often the prelude to the main event. Two people mounted horses and rode them towards each other. They used <break>
        laces, which were often 10 feet in length, to knock the opponent off the horse.

       The Pike was a weapon found in the middle and late medieval period in Europe. Avergaing in about 20 feet in length, the pike was handled with
       two hands and required high amounts of strength to wield. The length of the Pike was proven as advantageous because it allowed the holder to strike
       from a safer distance. At the tip, a strong metal layed sturdy for combat pruposes.
